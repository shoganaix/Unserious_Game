## Project Objective
The primary aim of this project is to create an engaging and fun local multiplayer experience, featuring dynamic gameplay that allows players to interact and compete in a playful office environment.

## Game Overview
One player will take on the role of a mischievous squirrel bent on destroying an office scene by knocking over supplies and more (destroying five highlighted objects around the room results in a win). 

The other player will play as a human attempting to restore order, with the goal of catching the squirrel three times to secure a win. 

Both characters come with unique abilities, such as dashes and pushes.
